Hello Ruby Quiz
This is a single screen app, quizzing the user on computational thinking as introduced by the animated children’s book Hello Ruby! 
This project is my final submission for the Google ALC 3.0 challenge.
This app quizzes the user on computational thinking knowledge after covering the Hello Ruby, Adventures in coding illustrated book for children.

The app scope includes 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.

Prerequisites
This app uses minimum target SDK of Android 15.
